### ✅ OpenAI: GPT-5.6 long-context pricing now officially published (verified 2026-07-17)

**Provider:** [OpenAI](models/openai.md)  
The official OpenAI API pricing page (`developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing`, last verified 2026-07-17) now shows explicit long-context rates for all GPT-5.6 models. The July 10 entry noted this as "not yet officially published; single flat rate in effect during launch period." That caveat is now resolved.

**Long-context rates (tokens >272K in a request):**

| Model | Input (short) | Input (long >272K) | Output (short) | Output (long >272K) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | $5.00 | $10.00 | $30.00 | $45.00 |
| `gpt-5.6-sol-pro` | $30.00 | $60.00 | $180.00 | $270.00 |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | $2.50 | $5.00 | $15.00 | $22.50 |
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | $1.00 | $2.00 | $6.00 | $9.00 |

These match the pattern established for GPT-5.5 (2× input and output above the 272K threshold). The cache-write column is not yet broken out separately for long-context; cache-read rates are assumed proportional.

**Developer action:** If you're building long-context agents or document-processing pipelines on GPT-5.6, re-model your cost estimates with the 2× uplift for any prompt exceeding 272K tokens.

### ✅ OpenAI Realtime: `gpt-realtime-2.1` and `gpt-realtime-2.1-mini` now listed on official pricing page (verified 2026-07-17)

**Provider:** [OpenAI](models/openai.md)  
The official OpenAI API pricing page now lists `gpt-realtime-2.1` and `gpt-realtime-2.1-mini` as the current production realtime voice models. The previous entries (`gpt-realtime-2`, `gpt-realtime-mini`) are still accessible but the `.1` variants are now the listed default.

Pricing is structurally unchanged from the 2.x generation — same per-token audio, text, and image rates. The `.1` designation reflects a capability/stability bump, not a pricing change.

| Model | Audio input | Text input | Image input | Audio output | Text output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gpt-realtime-2.1` | $32.00/1M | $4.00/1M | $5.00/1M | $64.00/1M | $24.00/1M |
| `gpt-realtime-2.1-mini` | $10.00/1M | $0.60/1M | $0.80/1M | $20.00/1M | $2.40/1M |

### ⏱️ DeepSeek V4 peak pricing: still NOT activated as of 2026-07-17

**Provider:** [DeepSeek](models/deepseek.md)  
The official DeepSeek API pricing page still shows **flat rates only** as of today, July 17. The `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` hard retirement is now **7 days away** (2026-07-24 15:59 UTC).

No 24-hour advance notice email for peak pricing has been sent as of this writing. Flat rates remain in effect for all time windows.

**Critical action (7 days remaining):** Migrate from `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` to explicit V4 model IDs:
- `deepseek-chat` → `deepseek-v4-flash` (non-thinking)
- `deepseek-reasoner` → `deepseek-v4-flash` with thinking enabled

After July 24 15:59 UTC, calls to the legacy aliases will return **errors** (not silent redirects).

**Provider:** [DeepSeek](models/deepseek.md)  
The official [DeepSeek API pricing page](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing) still shows **flat-rate pricing** as of today, July 16:

| Model | Cache miss input | Cache hit input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `deepseek-v4-flash` | $0.14 / 1M | $0.0028 / 1M | $0.28 / 1M |
| `deepseek-v4-pro` | $0.435 / 1M | $0.003625 / 1M | $0.87 / 1M |

The peak/off-peak pricing mechanism announced June 29 (approximately **2× rates** during 09:00–12:00 and 14:00–18:00 Beijing Time / UTC+8) has **not yet taken effect**. DeepSeek committed to send a **24-hour advance notice email** before the change activates. As of this writing, no such notice has been sent.

**What to expect when it activates:**

| Period | V4 Flash input | V4 Flash output | V4 Pro input | V4 Pro output |

### 🔴 Google: Gemini 3.5 Flash **50% price cut** — $0.75/$4.50 Standard (was $1.50/$9.00)

**Provider:** [Google](models/google.md)  
The official [Google Gemini Developer API pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing) (last updated 2026-07-09 UTC) now shows **Gemini 3.5 Flash** at **$0.75 input / $4.50 output** per 1M tokens — exactly half the launch price of $1.50/$9.00 from May 2026. This is the Standard (real-time) rate. What was previously the Batch/Flex rate is now the Standard rate.

| Tier | Old rate | New rate |
|---|---|---|
| Input (Standard) | $1.50 / 1M | **$0.75 / 1M** |
| Output (Standard) | $9.00 / 1M | **$4.50 / 1M** |
| Cached input (Standard) | $0.15 / 1M | **$0.075 / 1M** |

**Impact:** Gemini 3.5 Flash is now **62% cheaper than Gemini 3.1 Pro** ($2.00/$12.00) at Standard rates, while outperforming it on coding and agentic benchmarks. It is also cheaper than GPT-5.6 Terra ($2.50/$15) and Grok 4.5 ($2.00/$6.00). Combined with its ~4× token generation speed advantage, this makes Gemini 3.5 Flash the most cost-efficient frontier-class model for API workloads as of today.

**No announcement yet from Google.** The pricing page change was verified by direct inspection of the official docs (last updated 2026-07-09 UTC). Third-party pricing aggregators (felloai.com, metacto.com, apidog.com) still show the old $1.50/$9.00 rate as of this writing. The new rate appears to have taken effect quietly around July 9.

### 🔴 Google: Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite **50% price cut** — $0.125/$0.75 Standard (was $0.25/$1.50)

**Provider:** [Google](models/google.md)  
Alongside the Gemini 3.5 Flash price cut, **Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite** has also been halved on the official pricing page:

| Tier | Old rate | New rate |
|---|---|---|
| Input (Standard) | $0.25 / 1M | **$0.125 / 1M** |
| Output (Standard) | $1.50 / 1M | **$0.75 / 1M** |
| Cached input | $0.025 / 1M | **$0.0125 / 1M** |

At $0.125/$0.75, Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite is now the cheapest Gemini 3.x model and among the cheapest frontier-adjacent APIs available. Rivals Mistral Nemo ($0.02/$0.06) and GPT-4.1 Nano ($0.10/$0.40) on price.

### ✅ Anthropic: Claude Fable 5 free subscription window CLOSED — usage credits now required

**Provider:** [Anthropic](models/anthropic.md)  
The promotional free-access window for **Claude Fable 5** on paid subscription plans closed as of **July 12, 2026 at 11:59 PM PT**. As of today, July 13, access to `claude-fable-5` requires **usage credits** funded in the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/settings/billing), billed at standard API rates:

| Model | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-fable-5` | $10.00 / 1M | $50.00 / 1M |
| Fallback: `claude-opus-4-8` | $5.00 / 1M | $25.00 / 1M |

**Action required:** If you are using `claude-fable-5` on a Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise plan without API keys, verify that usage credits are enabled in your console. If credits are not funded, API calls will return auth/billing errors. Interactive claude.ai access may continue to surface Fable 5 at reduced limits depending on your plan — check [Anthropic's pricing page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing) for current plan entitlements. Production API usage requires explicit usage credits enabled.

**Why Fable 5?** Despite being 2× the price of Opus 4.8, Fable 5 delivers substantially better agentic coding performance: SWE-bench Pro 80.3% vs. 69.2% for Opus 4.8. If you're running autonomous software agents, the output quality gain likely justifies the cost.

### 🆕 Google: Managed Agents API expanded — background tasks, remote MCP, custom functions (2026-07-07)

**Provider:** [Google](models/google.md)  
Google announced four new capabilities for Managed Agents in the Gemini API on **July 7, 2026**, making them more viable for production workloads:

| New capability | What it enables |
|---|---|
| **Background execution** | Fire-and-forget agent tasks — no need to keep connection open; poll or receive webhook on completion |
| **Remote MCP server integration** | Agents can call any remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server as a tool — extend without rebuilding sandbox |
| **Custom function calling** | Define and expose custom tools/functions to the agent at runtime, beyond built-in tools |
| **Credential refresh** | OAuth tokens and API credentials can be refreshed mid-session — enables agents that run longer than token expiry windows |

**API identifier:** `antigravity-preview-05-2026` (same; capabilities expanded in-place)  
**Access:** [Gemini API docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/agents) and Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform

**Developer note:** Background execution is the most impactful addition for production pipelines — previously, managed agent tasks required an open WebSocket or HTTP connection for the duration of execution. Remote MCP integration directly addresses the feedback that sandboxed agents couldn't reach custom tooling without baking it in.

### 🆕 Mistral: Studio launched (2026-07-09)

**Provider:** [Mistral](models/mistral.md)  
Mistral launched **Studio** on July 9, 2026 — a prompt and skills management platform for production AI teams. Positioned as "a system of record for AI prompts and skills — versioned, owned, and traceable."

**What it adds:**
- Version control for prompts and skills (edit history, rollback, diffs)
- Ownership and audit trail — who created or changed each prompt/skill, and when
- Live integration with La Plateforme — test prompt changes in-place without re-deploying
- MCP connector integration — reuse prompt skills as tools via built-in/custom MCP connectors
- Team collaboration: share, fork, and comment on prompts across workspaces

**Access:** Pro, Team, and Enterprise Le Chat plans. Prompts also accessible as API templates.

**Developer note:** Fills a gap that most teams handle with ad-hoc version tracking in git or notebooks. Particularly useful for teams using Mistral Vibe or the Search Toolkit (both launched May 28, 2026) where prompt evolution across agent tasks has been hard to trace.

### 📰 Google: Gemini 3.5 Pro still unreleased — delay attributed to GPT-5.6 / Grok 4.5 competition (2026-07-13)

**Provider:** [Google](models/google.md)  
**Gemini 3.5 Pro** remains unreleased as of today (July 13, 2026). The model was announced at Google I/O (May 19) for "next month" release, delayed past June, and now past mid-July. No official release date has been given.

Community discussion on r/GeminiAI (July 2026) suggests the extended delay is competitive — Google needs a model that can genuinely compete with GPT-5.6 Sol and Grok 4.5, both of which launched this week. The current Gemini 3.5 Flash ($1.50/$9.00) remains the strongest available Gemini model for API use.

**What is confirmed when it does ship:**
- Context window: ~2M tokens  
- Reasoning: "Deep Think" mode  
- Expected pricing: ~$15/$60 per 1M tokens  
- Available in limited Vertex AI enterprise preview

**Developer action:** Do not plan production integrations that depend on Gemini 3.5 Pro. Use `gemini-3.5-flash` ($1.50/$9.00) or `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` ($2.00/$12.00, 94.3% GPQA) in the interim.

**Affected plans:** Pro ($20/mo), Max 5x ($100/mo), Max 20x ($200/mo), Team Standard, Team Premium, and select Enterprise plans.

**Timeline recap:**
- **2026-06-09:** Fable 5 launched; free access through June 22 announced.
- **2026-06-12:** US export controls suspended access globally (wiped out most of the original free window).
- **2026-07-01:** Access restored globally after export controls lifted June 30.
- **2026-07-07:** Extended deadline (originally July 7 → July 12) announced on X.
- **2026-07-12 11:59 PM PT:** ← **TODAY** — free window closes; usage credits required going forward.

**Developer action:** If you're using Fable 5 via subscription on an API key or `claude.ai` + tools, check whether usage credits are enabled on your account. To continue API access after tonight, usage credits must be funded. Interactive Claude.ai access and Claude Code may still surface Fable 5 to subscriptions at reduced limits — confirm via [Anthropic's pricing page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing). Fallback: `claude-opus-4-8` at $5/$25 per 1M.

### 🚨 Anthropic: Claude Fable 5 / Mythos 5 — still SUSPENDED (day 7)

**Provider:** [Anthropic](models/anthropic.md)  
No update from Anthropic on restoring access to Fable 5 or Mythos 5. Both models remain offline globally as of today. A Manifold prediction market (as of 2026-06-19) puts ~52% probability on full restoration by July 1. Until access is restored, `claude-opus-4-8` ($5/$25 per 1M) remains the recommended Anthropic model.

**Developer note:** Keep `claude-opus-4-8` in your fallback configuration. Do not re-enable `claude-fable-5` routing without testing — restoring access after a regulatory hold may be incremental (e.g., US-only first).

### 🆕 xAI: Grok on Databricks (2026-06-18)

**Provider:** [xAI](models/xai.md)  
Grok models are now natively available on **Databricks Agent Bricks**, announced at the Databricks 2026 Data + AI Summit (June 15–18, San Francisco).

The Wall Street Journal reported (June 10-11, 2026) that OpenAI is **mulling price cuts** for paid access to its models. The move is reportedly preemptive — anticipating similar cuts from rival Anthropic (which confidentially filed for an IPO on June 1, 2026). No official pricing changes have been announced as of 2026-06-17. Current GPT-5.5 pricing remains $5.00/$30.00 per 1M tokens.

**Developer action:** No changes required now. Monitor OpenAI's pricing page if you are locked into pricing assumptions in production budgets.

### 🔄 Anthropic: Agent SDK billing split PAUSED — NOT live as of June 15

**Provider:** [Anthropic](models/anthropic.md)  
The changelog entry from 2026-06-15 stated the Agent SDK billing split "went into effect." **This was incorrect.** According to a June 16 update from Digital Applied (citing Anthropic's own actions), Anthropic **paused the change before it took effect** on June 15. The Agent SDK credit split is **not currently live**. Subscription usage continues as before — autonomous/programmatic Agent SDK, `claude -p`, GitHub Actions, and third-party integrations still draw from the regular subscription pool.

Anthropic has stated it will re-announce the change with advance notice before it ships. No revised date announced.

**Impact on developers:** No action needed right now. If you prepared for the June 15 change, remain prepared — but you are not being charged at API rates for autonomous workloads yet.

**Provider:** [xAI](models/xai.md)  
xAI announced that Grok models are now available inside the **Warp terminal** (warp.dev) as of June 15, 2026. Warp users can connect their **SuperGrok subscription** (OAuth-based, not an API key) to route Grok model inference through their xAI account, consuming their SuperGrok limits instead of Warp credits. When a SuperGrok subscription is connected, Warp does **not** consume any Warp credits for Grok requests.

**Key details:**
- Connection method: OAuth sign-in to xAI account (no API key required)
- Available to Free and eligible paid Warp plans for individuals and orgs ≤ 10 employees
- Token storage: OAuth tokens stored only on the user's device (OS keychain), never on Warp servers
- Zero data retention: Data retention is governed by the user's xAI account terms (Warp cannot enforce ZDR for subscription-routed requests)

### ⚠️ Google: Gemini CLI / Gemini Code Assist consumer shutdown — **June 18, 2026 (3 DAYS)**

**Provider:** [Google](models/google.md)  
Google's **Gemini CLI** and **Gemini Code Assist IDE extensions** stop serving all Google AI Pro, Ultra, and free Gemini Code Assist for individuals users on **June 18, 2026**. The successor is the **Antigravity CLI** (`agy` binary).

> ⚠️ **Enterprise exception:** Organizations on Gemini Code Assist Standard/Enterprise licenses or paid API keys are **not** affected — this is a consumer-tier shutdown only.

**What breaks on June 18 for consumer users:**
- `gemini` CLI binary stops serving
- Gemini Code Assist IDE extensions (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.) stop serving
- Gemini Code Assist for GitHub: no new org installations; existing requests stop serving in the following weeks

**Migration:** Install the Antigravity CLI (`agy`). Note: the migration script does not update CI/CD pipelines or automation. One known silent failure: a specific MCP `serverUrl` config field fails without an error. Test carefully before cutover.

### 🚨 Anthropic: Claude Fable 5 and Mythos 5 SUSPENDED — US export control directive (2026-06-12)

**Provider:** [Anthropic](models/anthropic.md)  
The most consequential AI regulatory event of 2026 so far. On **June 12, 2026 at 5:21 PM ET**, the U.S. Commerce Department (Secretary Howard Lutnick) issued an export control directive ordering Anthropic to suspend all access to Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5 by any foreign national, whether inside or outside the United States — including Anthropic's own foreign national employees. Because ordinary service made targeted compliance impossible, Anthropic disabled both models **for all customers globally**.

**Timeline:**
- **June 9, 2026:** Claude Fable 5 (public) and Claude Mythos 5 (Glasswing partners) launched. Best-in-class coding/reasoning model; SWE-bench Pro 80.3%.
- **June 12, 2026 at 5:21 PM ET:** U.S. government directive received. Both models taken offline for all users, no warning window.
- **June 13, 2026:** Anthropic published [full statement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/fable-mythos-access) disputing the directive's basis.

**Why:** The government's stated reason was a claimed jailbreak of Fable/Mythos that could enable cybersecurity harm. Anthropic's review found the technique demonstrated "a small number of previously known, minor vulnerabilities" and that "other publicly-available models (including OpenAI's GPT-5.5) are able to discover them as well."

**Current status (2026-06-13):** Both models remain offline. Anthropic says it is "working to restore access as soon as possible." No timeline given.

**Impact on developers:**
- `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5` API calls return errors
- All other Claude models (Opus 4.8, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5, etc.) are **unaffected**
- Migrate to `claude-opus-4-8` ($5/$25 per 1M) for best available Anthropic performance
- The June 22 free-subscription-access deadline is now moot until access is restored

**Provider:** [xAI](models/xai.md)  
xAI added **Composer 2.5** as a second model inside the Grok Build CLI on June 1, 2026. Based on an open-source checkpoint of Moonshot's Kimi K2.5, trained with 25× more synthetic tasks than Composer 2. Optimized for long-running tasks and complex instruction-following.

| Pricing | Rate |
|---|---|
| Input (standard) | $0.50 / 1M tokens |
| Output (standard) | $2.50 / 1M tokens |
| Input (fast variant) | $3.00 / 1M tokens |
| Output (fast variant) | $15.00 / 1M tokens |

**Note:** This is a third-party model (Kimi K2.5 base) integrated into Grok Build — not an xAI-trained model. Not available on the standard xAI API (`docs.x.ai/developers/models`).  
**Access:** SuperGrok and X Premium+ subscribers via `/model` menu in Grok Build.

### ⚠️ Mistral: PyPI supply chain attack — `mistralai==2.4.6` was malicious (2026-05-11)

**Provider:** [Mistral](models/mistral.md)  
Security alert (not a model/API change). On May 11, 2026, attackers published `mistralai==2.4.6` to PyPI — a version Mistral AI never released. The package contained a backdoor that fires at import time on Linux, steals credentials (API keys, cloud tokens, CI/CD tokens, GitHub tokens), and in some cases triggers destructive commands.

**Who is affected:** Developers who installed `mistralai` via pip between ~May 10–12, 2026 on Linux systems.

**Immediate actions:**
1. `pip uninstall mistralai && pip install mistralai==2.4.5` (or latest legitimate version)
2. Rotate all secrets on the affected host
3. Check for `/tmp/transformers.pyz` and outbound connections to `83.142.209.194`

**Not affected:** Raw HTTP users; LiteLLM users (no `mistralai` SDK import).

Added security advisory section to `models/mistral.md`.

### ⚠️ Gemini 3.5 Flash pricing CORRECTION — $2.70/$16.20 (not $1.50/$9.00)

**Provider:** [Google](models/google.md)  
The Gemini 3.5 Flash pricing recorded on 2026-05-19 was based on pre-launch estimates and was **incorrect**. The official Google AI Developer API pricing page (last updated **2026-05-19 UTC**) shows:

| Metric | Correct value | Previously recorded |
|---|---|---|
| Input (per 1M tokens) | **$2.70** | ~~$1.50~~ |
| Output (per 1M tokens, incl. thinking) | **$16.20** | ~~$9.00~~ |
| Context caching | **$0.27 / 1M** | ~~$0.15~~ |

All pricing ratios are consistent: output is 6× input; caching is 10% of input. This pricing positions Gemini 3.5 Flash above Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview ($2.00/$12.00) rather than below it — which aligns with Google's positioning of 3.5 Flash as their strongest model yet.

**Grounding:** 5,000 prompts/month free (shared across Gemini 3 family), then **$14 / 1,000 search queries**.

### ⚠️ Anthropic: Claude Agent SDK usage split into dedicated credit pool — effective June 15, 2026

**Provider:** [Anthropic](models/anthropic.md)  
Anthropic [announced](https://x.com/ClaudeDevs/status/2054610152817619388) a major billing change for Claude Code subscriptions, effective **June 15, 2026**: programmatic/autonomous Claude usage is being separated from interactive usage into its own credit pool, billed at standard API rates.

**What's changing:**
- **Human-in-the-loop usage** (Claude Code terminal, web chat, desktop app, Cowork): continues drawing from existing subscription limits as before.
- **Autonomous / programmatic usage** (Agent SDK, `claude -p`, GitHub Actions, third-party tools like OpenClaw/Zed/Cursor): **moves to a new monthly Agent SDK credit**, billed at standard API token rates.

**Agent SDK credits by plan:**

| Plan | Monthly Agent SDK credit | Overage |
|---|---|---|
| Pro ($20/mo) | $20 in API credits | Billed at standard API rates if extra usage enabled; stops if not |
| Max 5x ($100/mo) | $100 in API credits | Billed at standard API rates if extra usage enabled |
| Max 20x ($200/mo) | $200 in API credits | Billed at standard API rates if extra usage enabled |

**Developer impact:** Subscriptions previously subsidized autonomous agent workloads at roughly 15–30× cheaper than API rates. With the credit pool billed at API rates ($5/$25 per 1M on Opus 4.7; $3/$15 on Sonnet 4.6), heavy autonomous workflows will cost significantly more starting June 15. Users who relied on OpenClaw, Zed (via ACP), or `claude -p` pipelines for long-running agent tasks are most affected.

**Context:** Anthropic's April 4 change (banning third-party agent tools from subscriptions entirely) was partly reversed — tools like OpenClaw are now re-allowed, but placed on the metered credit pool rather than the main subscription. This is a structured middle path. Note that the Zed editor, which uses ACP (Agent Client Protocol), is now in the same bucket as third-party agent frameworks for billing purposes.

### 🆕 xAI: Grok Build coding agent launched (early beta, SuperGrok Heavy only)

**Provider:** [xAI](models/xai.md)  
xAI launched **Grok Build** on May 14, 2026 — an early beta coding agent and CLI targeting professional software engineering. Available now for **SuperGrok Heavy** subscribers ($300/month); broader availability not yet announced.

**Key capabilities:**
- Interactive TUI with plan mode (review/approve before execution)
- Parallel subagents for complex multi-step tasks
- Headless mode (`-p`) for scripts and CI automations
- Agent Client Protocol (ACP) for building orchestration apps
- Compatible with AGENTS.md, existing plugins, hooks, skills, MCP servers
- Underlying model: `grok-4.3` (standard API pricing applies when using API key)

**Developer context:** Enters a crowded market vs. Anthropic's Claude Code and OpenAI's Codex CLI, both of which have significant head starts in IDE integrations and production deployments. xAI CEO Elon Musk acknowledged in March 2026 that xAI has lagged behind competitors in coding.

### ✅ xAI: May 15 retirements COMPLETED — slugs redirect (not error); silent 6× cost risk

**Provider:** [xAI](models/xai.md)  
The 8 model retirements announced for today (2026-05-15 at 12pm PT) are now effective. **Critical correction from prior entries:** The retired model slugs **do not return errors** — they **automatically redirect to `grok-4.3`** per the [official xAI migration guide](https://docs.x.ai/developers/migration/may-15-retirement). Previous changelog entries (2026-05-13 and 2026-05-14) incorrectly stated that "requests will no longer work" and "return errors."

**What this means for developers:**
- Code that still uses `grok-4-fast-reasoning`, `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning`, `grok-4-0709`, `grok-code-fast-1`, `grok-3`, etc. will **not break immediately**
- However, those requests are now **silently billed at `grok-4.3` pricing** ($1.25 input / $2.50 output per 1M tokens)
- If you relied on the Fast model pricing ($0.20 input / $0.50 output), you are now paying **~6× more per request** without any API error to alert you
- `grok-imagine-image-pro` redirects to `grok-imagine-image-quality`

**Action required:** Update your `model` field explicitly. Even if your code doesn't break, staying on old slugs means you lose the ability to control `reasoning_effort` and you will be over-paying.

### 🔧 xAI: Voice API TTS pricing corrected — $4.20/1M chars (launch) → $15.00/1M chars (current official)

**Provider:** [xAI](models/xai.md)  
The xAI Voice API launched on **2026-04-17** with TTS priced at **$4.20 / 1M characters**. The official xAI pricing page (last updated 2026-05-09) now shows **$15.00 / 1M characters** for TTS. This is a 3.6× increase from the launch price. STT pricing is unchanged.

| Mode | Launch price (2026-04-17) | Current price (2026-05-09) |
|---|---|---|
| TTS (Text-to-Speech) | $4.20 / 1M characters | **$15.00 / 1M characters** |
| STT REST (batch) | $0.10 / hour | $0.10 / hour (unchanged) |
| STT WebSocket (streaming) | $0.20 / hour | $0.20 / hour (unchanged) |
| Voice Agent (realtime) | $0.05 / min ($3.00/hr) | $0.05 / min ($3.00/hr) (unchanged) |

Even at $15.00/1M, Grok TTS is still significantly cheaper than OpenAI TTS ($30.00/1M characters via Realtime API context), Google WaveNet ($16.00/1M), Azure TTS ($16.00/1M), and ElevenLabs (~$50.00/1M). STT ($0.10/hr batch) remains the market's lowest.

Pricing is identical: **$1.25 / 1M input · $2.50 / 1M output · $0.20 / 1M cached input**. 2M context window. This model ID explicitly exposes the multi-agent (4-agent parallel reasoning) capability that was previously available only via the standard `grok-4.20` alias.

### 🔧 Anthropic: Claude Sonnet 4 / Opus 4 retirement date CORRECTED — June 15, 2026 (not May 14)

**Provider:** [Anthropic](models/anthropic.md)  
The previous changelog entry (2026-05-13) stated that `claude-sonnet-4-*` and `claude-opus-4-*` were shutting down "TOMORROW (May 14, 2026)". This was **incorrect**. The [official Anthropic model deprecations page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations) clearly shows:

- `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` — deprecated 2026-04-14 — **retirement: June 15, 2026**
- `claude-opus-4-20250514` — deprecated 2026-04-14 — **retirement: June 15, 2026**

The error arose from misreading the "Not before 2026-05-14" language in our legacy model table, which was a minimum retention guarantee, not the actual retirement date. Corrected in `deprecated.md`, `models/anthropic.md`, and `comparison.md`.

| Field | Previous (incorrect) | Corrected |
|---|---|---|
| Sonnet 4 retirement | 2026-05-14 | **2026-06-15** |
| Opus 4 retirement | 2026-05-14 | **2026-06-15** |

### ⚠️ Anthropic: Claude Opus 4.7 — new tokenizer uses up to 35% more tokens than Opus 4.6

**Provider:** [Anthropic](models/anthropic.md)  
Per-token pricing for Opus 4.7 is **unchanged** from Opus 4.6 at $5.00/$25.00 per 1M tokens. However, Opus 4.7 ships with a new tokenizer that may use **up to 35% more tokens** for identical input text. The effective per-request cost can therefore be up to 1.35× higher than Opus 4.6 for the same content — even though the rate card looks identical.

Highest impact cases:
- **Code** — token count can be significantly higher
- **Structured data** (JSON, XML) — longer token representations
- **Non-English text** — tokenizer changes disproportionately affect non-Latin scripts

Recommended action: after migrating to `claude-opus-4-7`, monitor actual token counts in API responses and re-benchmark costs before finalizing production budgets.

Added note to `models/anthropic.md`.

### 🚨 xAI: 8 models retire TODAY (May 15, 2026 at 12pm PT)

**Provider:** [xAI](models/xai.md)  
Today is the deadline. **Effective 2026-05-15 at 12:00pm PT**, the following xAI models will return errors on all API requests:

| Retiring model | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` | `grok-4.3` |
| `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning` | `grok-4.3` (reasoning_effort: none) |
| `grok-4-fast-reasoning` | `grok-4.3` |
| `grok-4-fast-non-reasoning` | `grok-4.3` (reasoning_effort: none) |
| `grok-4-0709` | `grok-4.3` |
| `grok-code-fast-1` | `grok-4.3` |
| `grok-3` | `grok-4.3` |
| `grok-imagine-image-pro` | `grok-imagine-image-quality` |

**Cost impact reminder:** `grok-4.3` ($1.25/$2.50 per 1M) is ~6× more expensive than the retired Fast models ($0.20/$0.50). Evaluate whether you need `grok-4.3` or if a cheaper alternative (e.g. Mistral Small 4 at $0.15/$0.60) fits your use case.

### 🔄 DeepSeek: API pricing corrected back to V3.2 — $0.28/$0.42 per 1M tokens (reverts 2026-04-14 entry)

**Provider:** [DeepSeek](models/deepseek.md)  
The official DeepSeek API docs (re-verified 2026-04-18) now clearly state that both `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` correspond to **DeepSeek-V3.2**, priced at **$0.28 input / $0.42 output** per 1M tokens (cache miss), with cache-hit input at **$0.028/1M** (90% discount). This corrects the 2026-04-14 entry which logged V3.1-Terminus at $0.56/$1.68 — that appears to have been a transient documentation change that has since been reverted, or a data error. Current official pricing is back to the V3.2 standard rates.

### ⚠️ DeepSeek: Official API pricing updated — V3.1-Terminus now $0.56/$1.68 per 1M tokens

**Provider:** [DeepSeek](models/deepseek.md)  
The official DeepSeek API pricing page now shows **DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus** behind both `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` endpoints, at **$0.56 input / $1.68 output** per 1M tokens (cache miss), with cache-hit input at **$0.07/1M** (~87% discount). This is a significant increase from the $0.28/$0.42 rates recorded on 2026-04-13, which appear to have reflected third-party provider or older pricing rather than the official API.

- Cache-miss input: $0.28 → **$0.56** (+100%)
- Output: $0.42 → **$1.68** (+300%)
- Cache-hit input: $0.028 → **$0.07** (+150%)
- Model behind endpoints: V3.2 → **V3.1-Terminus** per official docs

> **Note on discrepancy:** Third-party providers (OpenRouter, Fireworks AI, Together AI) still offer DeepSeek V3.2 at $0.18–$0.28/M input — these are reseller rates for self-hosted weights, not the official API. For the official `api.deepseek.com`, use the rates above.
