xAI's newest and recommended flagship. ~40% price cut vs. Grok 4.20; expanded to 1M context window; native video input support; Voice API launched same day.

> xAI explicitly states: *"We strongly recommend all API callers use grok-4.3. It is the most intelligent and fastest model we've built."*

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| API names | `grok-4.3` · `grok-4.3-latest` · `grok-latest` |
| Context window | 1,000,000 tokens |
| Input | **$1.25 / 1M** |
| Cached input | **$0.20 / 1M** |
| Output | **$2.50 / 1M** |

| Code execution | $5.00 / 1K calls |
| File attachments | $10.00 / 1K calls |
| Safety filter violation fee | $0.05 / blocked request |

**Higher context pricing** applies to requests exceeding 200K total tokens (rate TBD per region; see [xAI docs](https://docs.x.ai/developers/models/grok-4.3)).

**Reasoning effort:** Configurable — `none`, `low`, `medium` (default), `high`. Reasoning tokens billed at standard completion token rate.

**Key capabilities:** Vision input, tool calling/function calling, structured outputs, prompt caching, batch API, provisioned throughput.

**Voice API (launched 2026-04-17; pricing updated 2026-05-09):**
- Voice Agent (Realtime): **$3.00 / hour** ($0.05 / minute), WebSocket-based; up to 30 min sessions
- TTS: **$15.00 / 1M characters** (REST + WebSocket streaming; 5 voices, 20+ languages)
- STT: **$0.10 / hour** (REST batch) · **$0.20 / hour** (WebSocket streaming); 25+ languages, speaker diarization

> ⚠️ **Pricing correction (2026-05-15):** At launch (2026-04-17), xAI TTS was priced at $4.20/1M characters. The official pricing page (last updated 2026-05-09) now shows **$15.00 / 1M characters**. STT pricing is unchanged ($0.10/hr batch, $0.20/hr streaming). Grok Voice Agent (realtime) remains $3.00/hr.

> ✅ **Retirement completed (2026-05-15 at 12pm PT):** Old model slugs now redirect to `grok-4.3`. See retirement section below — requests will NOT error, but will be silently billed at `grok-4.3` pricing. Update your `model` field explicitly.

---

### Grok 4.20 (Released 2026-03-31)

Previous flagship. 2M token context, agentic tool calling. Still available; pricing matches Grok 4.3 on the official xAI API page ($1.25/$2.50 input/output).

> **Note (2026-04-17):** The canonical dated model IDs are `grok-4.20-0309-reasoning` and `grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning`. The alias `grok-4.20` remains valid. The `-0309` suffix pins to the March 9 training checkpoint.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| API names | `grok-4.20-0309-reasoning` · `grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning` · `grok-4.20-multi-agent-0309` · `grok-4.20` (alias) |
| Context window | 2,000,000 tokens |
| Input | **$1.25 / 1M** |
| Cached input | **$0.20 / 1M** |
| Output | **$2.50 / 1M** |
| Web search | $5.00 / 1K calls |
| Knowledge cutoff | November 2024 |

**Architecture:** 4-agent system (Grok + Harper + Benjamin + Lucas) for parallel reasoning and cross-verification. "Heavy" variant uses 16 agents for deeper analysis.

**Key capabilities:** Reasoning (can be toggled on/off), vision, X (Twitter) real-time data access, image generation.

**GPQA Diamond:** ~88%

---

### Grok 4 (Released 2025-07-09)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| API name | `grok-4` |
| Context window | 256,000 tokens |
| Input | **$3.00 / 1M** |
| Cached input | $0.75 / 1M |
| Output | **$15.00 / 1M** |

Always-on reasoning model. No `reasoning_effort` parameter — reasoning cannot be disabled.  
`presencePenalty`, `frequencyPenalty`, and `stop` are not supported.

**GPQA Diamond:** 87.7% | **MMLU:** 86.6% | **LiveCodeBench:** 81.9%

---

### Grok 4 Fast / Grok 4.1 Fast (Recommended for most developers)

Near-frontier capability at a fraction of the flagship price. 2 M token context.

> **API name update (2026-04-15):** xAI's official API now surfaces these as `grok-4-fast-reasoning` and `grok-4-fast-non-reasoning`. `grok-4.1-fast` remains a valid alias. Both sets of names return identical pricing.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| API names | `grok-4-fast-reasoning` · `grok-4-fast-non-reasoning` · `grok-4.1-fast` |
| Context window | 2,000,000 tokens |
| Input | **$0.20 / 1M** |
| Cached input | $0.05 / 1M |
| Output | **$0.50 / 1M** |
| Live search | $25.00 / 1K sources |

Available in reasoning and non-reasoning variants. 40% fewer thinking tokens than Grok 4 on average.

**Best for:** Long documents, large codebases, extended agent workflows, high-volume tasks.

---

### Grok 4.20 — Pricing via xAI Characters API

xAI also offers a **characters-based pricing** option at **$4.20 / 1M characters** with 10 rps for Grok 4.20.

---

### Grok Code Fast (Coding-Specialist)

Coding-focused model derived from the Grok 4.1 Fast architecture, optimized for programming tasks.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| API name | `grok-code-fast-1` |
| Context window | 256,000 tokens |
| Input | **$0.20 / 1M** |
| Output | **$1.50 / 1M** |

**Best for:** Code generation, debugging, refactoring. Higher output price than Grok 4.1 Fast reflects longer code outputs. Vision not included.

---

### Grok 3 Beta (Legacy)

| Context | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 131,072 tokens | $3.00 / 1M | $15.00 / 1M |

---

### Grok 3 Mini Beta

| Context | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 131,072 tokens | $0.30 / 1M | $0.50 / 1M |

---

## Tools Pricing

| Tool | Price |
|---|---|
| Web search | $2.50–$5.00 / 1K calls (varies by model) |
| X (Twitter) search | Included with API access |
| Code execution | Per token |
| Collections search (RAG) | Per token |

---

## Subscription Plans (consumer)

| Plan | Price | Notes |

## ✅ Model Retirements — May 15, 2026 (COMPLETED TODAY)

**Effective 2026-05-15 at 12:00pm PT**, the following models were retired from the xAI API:

| Model retired | Auto-redirect target | Recommended explicit action |
|---|---|---|
| `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` | `grok-4.3` with `low` reasoning effort | Update to `grok-4.3` |
| `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning` | `grok-4.3` with `none` reasoning effort | Update to `grok-4.3` |
| `grok-4-fast-reasoning` | `grok-4.3` with `low` reasoning effort | Update to `grok-4.3` |
| `grok-4-fast-non-reasoning` | `grok-4.3` with `none` reasoning effort | Update to `grok-4.3` |
| `grok-4-0709` | `grok-4.3` with `low` reasoning effort | Update to `grok-4.3` |
| `grok-code-fast-1` | `grok-4.3` with `low` reasoning effort | Update to `grok-4.3` |
| `grok-3` | `grok-4.3` with `none` reasoning effort | Update to `grok-4.3` |
| `grok-imagine-image-pro` | `grok-imagine-image-quality` | Update to `grok-imagine-image-quality` |

> ✅ **Important correction (2026-05-15):** Per the official xAI migration guide, requests to retired model slugs **automatically redirect** to `grok-4.3` (previous entries said "return errors" — this was wrong). Your code will not break, but will be **silently charged at `grok-4.3` pricing** ($1.25/$2.50 per 1M) even if you were using the cheap Fast models ($0.20/$0.50). Update your `model` field explicitly to avoid unexpected cost increases.

**Pricing impact:** ~6× cost increase for teams using `grok-4-fast-*` ($0.20/$0.50) who have not yet migrated to `grok-4.3` ($1.25/$2.50).

## Composer 2.5 in Grok Build (Released 2026-06-01) 🆕

xAI added **Composer 2.5** as a second model option inside the Grok Build CLI on June 1, 2026.

**Key facts:**
- Based on an open-source checkpoint of Moonshot's Kimi K2.5, with 25× more synthetic training tasks than Composer 2
- Designed for long-running tasks and complex instruction-following; strengths in coding, agents, JSON, and tool use
