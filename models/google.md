## Current Models (Gemini 3.5 — Latest Generation)

### Gemini 3.5 Flash (Released 2026-05-19 — Google I/O 2026)

Google's newest Gemini model, announced at Google I/O 2026. Optimized for **speed and complex agentic tasks**. Outperforms Gemini 3.1 Pro on key agentic/coding benchmarks at ~25% lower cost. Now the **default model** powering the Gemini app and AI Mode in Google Search globally.

> ⚠️ **Pricing note (corrected 2026-06-09):** The changelog entry from 2026-05-20 stated $2.70/$16.20 as "corrected" pricing. This was wrong — it confused **Priority tier** rates with Standard rates. The official Google AI Developer API pricing page shows **$1.50 Standard / $2.70 Priority** for input and **$9.00 Standard / $16.20 Priority** for output. Standard tier is the default.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| API name | `gemini-3.5-flash` |
| Context window | 1,000,000 tokens |
| Max output | 64,000 tokens |
| Input (Standard) | **$1.50 / 1M** (text/image/video) |
| Output (Standard, incl. thinking) | **$9.00 / 1M** |
| Input (Priority) | $2.70 / 1M |
| Output (Priority) | $16.20 / 1M |
| Input (Batch/Flex) | $0.75 / 1M |
| Output (Batch/Flex) | $4.50 / 1M |
| Context caching | $0.15 / 1M (Standard) |
| Context caching (storage) | $1.00 / 1M tokens per hour |
| Free tier | ✅ (rate-limited) |

**Key facts:**
- Released at Google I/O 2026 keynote, **2026-05-19**; available immediately in Gemini API, Google AI Studio, Antigravity, and Vertex AI
- Outperforms Gemini 3.1 Pro on agentic/coding benchmarks: **Terminal-Bench 2.1: 76.2%**, GDPval-AA: 1656 Elo, MCP Atlas: 83.6%, CharXiv (multimodal): 84.2%
- At $1.50/$9.00 Standard, costs ~25% less than Gemini 3.1 Pro ($2.00/$12.00) while outscoring it on key benchmarks
- ~4× faster output token generation compared to other frontier models
- Built for long-horizon agentic tasks, complex coding, and multi-step workflows
- Replaces Gemini 3.1 Pro as the recommended API model for production agentic use
- **Gemini 3.5 Pro**: Still unreleased as of **2026-07-13**. Model was rebuilt following delayed June window. Community discussion (r/GeminiAI, July 2026) suggests the delay is partly driven by competitive pressure from GPT-5.6 and Grok 4.5. No official release date given. Expected: 2M context, "Deep Think" reasoning, ~$15/$60 per 1M tokens. Limited Vertex AI enterprise preview only. Do not plan production integrations around leaked dates.
- Grounding with Google Search: 5,000 prompts/month free (shared across Gemini 3 family), then **$14 / 1,000 queries**

**June 2026 updates to Gemini 3.5 Flash:**
- **Computer Use** (2026-06-24): `gemini-3.5-flash` now supports computer use — can see, reason, and take action across desktop, mobile, and browser environments. Billed at standard Gemini 3.5 Flash token rates. Improves on long-horizon and enterprise automation tasks (continuous software testing, knowledge work). *(Source: [Google Blog — Computer use in Gemini 3.5 Flash](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/introducing-computer-use-gemini-3-5-flash/) — 2026-06-24)*
- **Gemini 3.5 Pro**: Still unreleased as of **2026-07-13**. Delayed from June. Community discussion (r/GeminiAI, July 2026) attributes delay to competitive pressure from GPT-5.6 and Grok 4.5 — "they simply don't have a model that's ready to compete." Expected: 2M context, "Deep Think" reasoning, ~$15/$60 per 1M tokens. Available in limited Vertex AI enterprise preview only.

## Managed Agents API (Launched 2026-05-19 — Google I/O 2026) 🆕 NEW

Google launched the **Managed Agents API** at Google I/O 2026, enabling developers to spin up stateful, autonomous agents inside secure Google-hosted Linux sandboxes via a single API call. Removes infrastructure setup overhead.

**General-purpose managed agent:**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| API name | `antigravity-preview-05-2026` |
| Status | Public preview (as of 2026-05-19) |
| Capabilities | Plan, reason, write & execute code, manage files, browse web (inside sandbox) |

**Key facts:**
- Single API call provisions a fully isolated sandbox with the Antigravity agent harness
- Inherits Agent Platform's enterprise data privacy, governance, and security controls
- Stateful agents: maintain context across multiple interactions
- Antigravity SDK also released — lets developers deploy the agent harness on their own infrastructure with full customization
- Pricing: not yet published (preview); check [Agent Platform docs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/build/managed-agents)

### Managed Agents API — Expanded Capabilities (2026-07-07) 🆕

On July 7, 2026, Google announced four new capabilities for Managed Agents in the Gemini API, addressing developer feedback for production-ready deployments:

1. **Background execution:** Agents now run asynchronously in the background — dispatch a task and poll or receive a webhook when complete. No need to keep a connection open for long-running agent tasks.
2. **Remote MCP server integration:** Agents can call any remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server as a tool, enabling integration with third-party services and custom APIs without embedding them in the sandbox.
3. **Custom function calling:** Define and expose custom tools/functions to the agent at runtime, in addition to built-in tools like code execution and web search.
4. **Refreshing credentials across interactions:** Agents can now refresh API credentials (OAuth tokens, etc.) mid-session, enabling longer-running agents that span credential expiry windows.

**API name:** `antigravity-preview-05-2026` (same identifier; capabilities expanded in-place)  
**Access:** Gemini API (via [ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/agents](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/agents)) and Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform
