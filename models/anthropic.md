## Current Recommended Models (Fable 5 / Mythos-class)

### Claude Fable 5 (Released 2026-06-09) ✅ RESTORED 2026-07-01

> ✅ **ACCESS RESTORED 2026-07-01.** Export controls on Fable 5 were lifted on June 30, 2026. Fable 5 returned globally on July 1 across Claude Platform, claude.ai, Claude Code, and Claude Cowork. AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Foundry access is being restored as quickly as possible. For Pro, Max, Team, and select Enterprise plans, Fable 5 access is extended on paid plans through July 12; after that it moves to usage credits.
>
> ⚠️ **Continued caution advised:** The suspension lasted 19 days (June 12–July 1) due to a jailbreak vulnerability. Anthropic has implemented updated safeguards. Keep `claude-opus-4-8` in fallback configuration for production systems.

Anthropic's most capable widely available model. The first **Mythos-class** model released for general use — sits above the Opus tier. Built for the most demanding reasoning, long-horizon agentic work, large-scale coding, and complex knowledge work. Uses the same underlying model as Claude Mythos 5 but with strict safety classifiers for cybersecurity, biology, chemistry, and model distillation domains.

> ⚠️ **Data retention requirement:** Claude Fable 5 requires **30-day data retention** on the Claude API — it is **not available under zero data retention**. Plan accordingly for compliance requirements.

## Agent SDK Billing Split — ANNOUNCED but PAUSED (Announced 2026-05-14, Paused 2026-06-15)

> ⚠️ **UPDATE 2026-06-16:** Anthropic **paused this change before it took effect** on June 15, 2026. The Agent SDK credit split is **not currently live**. Subscription usage (interactive and autonomous) continues drawing from the same pool as before. Anthropic has said it will re-announce the change with advance notice before it ships. No new date announced.

Anthropic announced plans to separate autonomous/programmatic Claude usage from interactive usage, with an original effective date of **June 15, 2026** (now paused).

**As announced, the two usage buckets would have been:**
1. **Human-in-the-loop** (interactive): terminal Claude Code, web/desktop chat, Cowork — draws from existing subscription limits.
2. **Autonomous / programmatic** (agentic): Agent SDK, `claude -p`, GitHub Actions, third-party tools (OpenClaw, Zed via ACP, Cursor, etc.) — would draw from a new **Agent SDK credit pool** billed at standard API rates.

**Announced monthly Agent SDK credits per plan:**

| Plan | Included credit (API rates) | Overage |
|---|---|---|
| Pro ($20/mo) | $20 | Billed at API rates if extra usage enabled; else stops |
| Max 5x ($100/mo) | $100 | Billed at API rates if extra usage enabled |
| Max 20x ($200/mo) | $200 | Billed at API rates if extra usage enabled |

**Developer impact (when/if it ships):** Subscriptions previously subsidized autonomous workloads at roughly 15–30× below API rates. The credit pool is billed at standard API token prices ($3/$15 per 1M on Sonnet 4.6; $5/$25 on Opus 4.7). Heavy `claude -p` or OpenClaw/Zed users who treat their plan as "unlimited agentic compute" will face major cost increases. Interactive Claude Code use is unaffected.

## Claude Managed Agents — Scheduled Deployments & Vault Credentials (2026-06-09) 🆕

Two new public-beta capabilities added to Claude Managed Agents on **June 9, 2026** (same day as Fable 5 launch):

1. **Scheduled deployments:** Agents can now run on a cron schedule — each fire starts a new session that runs to completion. No scheduler to build or host. Use cases: nightly data syncs, weekly compliance scans, daily digests. Configurable via the platform (pause, resume, archive, trigger on demand).

2. **Vault environment variables:** Vaults now support injecting environment variables (API keys) into agent sandboxes for CLIs, SDKs, and other tools. The agent never sees the actual key — it's attached at the network boundary only for approved domains. Supports: Browserbase, KERNEL, Notion, Ramp, Sentry CLIs. Browserbase and KERNEL give agents **browser capabilities** for the first time.

## API Rate Limit Increase (May 2026)

Effective **2026-05-06**, Anthropic raised API rate limits for Claude Opus models — enabled by new compute capacity (SpaceX Colossus 1 deal: 300MW+ / 220K+ NVIDIA GPUs). Three changes effective immediately:
1. **Claude Code 5-hour rate limits doubled** for Pro, Max, Team, and seat-based Enterprise plans
2. **Peak hours limit reduction removed** for Claude Code on Pro and Max accounts
3. **API rate limits raised considerably** for Claude Opus models (see [official rate limits page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/rate-limits))

*Source: [Anthropic — Higher limits and SpaceX compute deal](https://www.anthropic.com/news/higher-limits-spacex) — 2026-05-06*

## API Policy Change (April 2026)

Effective **2026-04-04**, Claude Pro and Max subscriptions can **no longer be used to power third-party agent frameworks** (e.g. OpenClaw). Users must connect via direct API key with pay-as-you-go token billing. Affected subscribers received a one-time credit equal to their monthly plan cost. *Source: TechCrunch, 2026-04-04*

## Claude Mythos Preview (2026-04-07) — Gated / Not Publicly Available

> ⚠️ **Not available via public API.** Access is restricted to ~50 partner organizations under **Project Glasswing** for cybersecurity use only.

Anthropic's most capable model to date, described as a "step change" above Claude Opus 4.6. Excels at reasoning, coding, and — most notably — autonomous vulnerability discovery in software systems. Named internally "Capybara".

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| API name | `claude-mythos-preview` (gated) |
| Public API | ❌ No general availability |
| Preview pricing | **~$25.00 / 1M input** · **~$125.00 / 1M output** |
| General release date | Not announced |

**Why gated:** Anthropic identified Mythos as a cybersecurity risk if broadly released. Under Project Glasswing, ~50 infrastructure partners use it solely for defensive security scanning. In internal testing, it identified thousands of zero-day vulnerabilities, many decades old.

**What developers should know:** Mythos is the precursor to the next Claude generation. Its benchmark scores substantially exceed Opus 4.6 on software engineering and reasoning. No timeline for general availability has been announced. *Source: TechCrunch, Anthropic System Card — 2026-04-07*

## Claude 5 Roadmap

Anthropic's Claude 5 generation is underway. **Sonnet 5 "Fennec"** was released February 2026. With Opus 4.8 as the current flagship (released 2026-05-28), Claude 5 Opus remains anticipated **Q3 2026** (July–September). Separately, Anthropic's [draft S-1 filing](https://futurumgroup.com/insights/will-anthropics-draft-s-1-ignite-a-new-phase-in-the-ai-platform-race/) (2026-06-02) reported a $965B valuation and ~$30B annualized revenue run rate.
