## Current Models

### DeepSeek V4 (Released 2026-04-24) 🆕 NEW

DeepSeek's latest generation. Two variants with 1M context, both open-weight. Both support OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible APIs. Both support thinking mode and non-thinking mode.

> ⚠️ **`deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` will be retired on 2026-07-24 15:59 UTC.** They currently route to `deepseek-v4-flash` (non-thinking and thinking respectively). Migrate explicitly to V4 model IDs.

| Model | API name | Context | Max output | Input (cache miss) | Input (cache hit) | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| V4 Flash | `deepseek-v4-flash` | 1,000,000 tokens | 384,000 tokens | **$0.14 / 1M** | $0.0028 / 1M | **$0.28 / 1M** |
| V4 Pro | `deepseek-v4-pro` | 1,000,000 tokens | 384,000 tokens | **$0.435 / 1M** | $0.003625 / 1M | **$0.87 / 1M** |

> ✅ **V4 Pro promotional price is now permanent.** On **2026-05-24**, DeepSeek made the 75% discount permanent — the list price was lowered from $1.74/$3.48 to $0.435/$0.87. This is the ongoing price, not a promotional rate. *Source: [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/news/deepseek-v4-pro-75-percent-price-cut-permanent) — 2026-05-24 · [Official pricing docs](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing) confirmed $0.435/$0.87 as current price — verified 2026-07-11*

> 🚨 **IMMINENT: Peak/off-peak pricing arrives with V4 stable release — expected any day (mid-July 2026 = NOW).** DeepSeek announced (2026-06-29) that the stable V4 release (officially "mid-July") will introduce **time-of-day pricing** — approximately 2× rates during peak hours. As of 2026-07-15, the pricing page still shows flat rates. A 24-hour advance notice email will be sent before the change activates. **Watch your email.** Here are the announced rates:
>
> | Period | Hours (Beijing Time, UTC+8) | V4 Flash input | V4 Flash output | V4 Pro input | V4 Pro output |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | Off-peak (regular) | All other hours | $0.14 / 1M | $0.28 / 1M | $0.435 / 1M | $0.87 / 1M |
> | Peak | 09:00–12:00 & 14:00–18:00 | ~$0.29 / 1M | ~$0.59 / 1M | ~$0.88 / 1M | ~$1.76 / 1M |
>
> A 24-hour advance notice will be sent before the change takes effect. Continued API usage after the notice = acceptance of new pricing. Opt-out (with refund) available before the change. Cache hit rates also double during peak hours. This is the first time DeepSeek has introduced time-based surcharging. *Source: [Reddit r/DeepSeek](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepSeek/comments/1uio6yf/) · [Tech Buzz China on X](https://x.com/TechBuzzChina/status/2071745549917688075) — 2026-06-29 · verified 2026-07-11*

**Architecture:**
- **V4 Pro:** 1.6T total parameters / 49B active parameters — "performance rivaling the world's top closed-source models"
- **V4 Flash:** 284B total / 13B active parameters — fast, efficient, economical

**V4 Pro benchmarks:** Strong performance on AIME 2025, GPQA Diamond, SWE-bench, HumanEval; tech report on HuggingFace.

**Cache hit discount (from 2026-04-26):** Reduced to 1/50 of cache-miss input price (2% for Flash, 0.83% for Pro).

| Mode | API name | Context | Max output | Input (cache miss) | Input (cache hit) | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chat (non-thinking) | `deepseek-chat` ⚠️ | 128,000 tokens | 8,000 tokens | **$0.14 / 1M** ² | $0.0028 / 1M ² | **$0.28 / 1M** ² |
| Reasoner (thinking) | `deepseek-reasoner` ⚠️ | 128,000 tokens | 64,000 tokens | **$0.14 / 1M** ² | $0.0028 / 1M ² | **$0.28 / 1M** ² |

² Since 2026-04-24, `deepseek-chat` routes to **V4 Flash non-thinking** and `deepseek-reasoner` routes to **V4 Flash thinking** mode. Billed at V4 Flash rates. These aliases retire **2026-07-24 15:59 UTC**.

**New users:** 5 million free tokens upon registration (no credit card required)

## Open Weights

All DeepSeek models are released under permissive open-source licenses:
- Self-host on your own infrastructure to eliminate per-token costs
- Popular options: Together AI, Fireworks AI, Groq, Nebius AI, Hyperbolic

**Best for:** Cost-sensitive production workloads, high-volume batch processing, teams who want to self-host, privacy-conscious deployments.

## Model Architecture Notes

- `deepseek-v4-flash` = DeepSeek-V4-Flash, non-thinking by default (switch via API param); fast, general-purpose
- `deepseek-v4-pro` = DeepSeek-V4-Pro, higher capability, thinking by default
- `deepseek-chat` = currently routes to V4-Flash non-thinking mode (legacy alias, retires 2026-07-24)
- `deepseek-reasoner` = currently routes to V4-Flash thinking mode (legacy alias, retires 2026-07-24)
- FIM (fill-in-middle) completion available on `deepseek-chat` (beta)
- JSON output supported on both modes; function calling on `deepseek-chat` only (if tools param sent to `deepseek-reasoner`, request routes to `deepseek-chat` internally)
- Context caching is automatic
